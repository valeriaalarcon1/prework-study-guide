          <li>JavaScript works with our webpages, and you can see how by using Chrome Developer Tools (go to inspect).</li>
          <li>var variable_name = "expression": Declared a variable and gives it a name to reference information stored in the variable in the code.</li>
          <li>The expression of the variable, in the quotation marks, can be a list or array.</li>
          <li>console.log(variable_name) is a method to output a message to the web console (Chrome DevTools, inspect) by adding an argument.</li>
          <li>Connect css to html by adding a script into the html code after end of footer and before end of body.</li>
          <li>Use for loops to perform a task on all items in the array in the expression by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over, rather than manually write lines of code for each item in the array, represented by an index number, 0 being the first one.</li>
          <li>In a for loop, var x = 0 means the starting point for the loop is the first index of the array, alwasy 0.</li>
          <li>In a for loop, x is less than variable_name.lenth will keep the loop running because it executes one time for each item in the array.</li>
          <li>In a for loop, x++ means every time the code loops, x will increase by 1</li>
