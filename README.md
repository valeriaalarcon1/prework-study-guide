# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for myself and for anyone that is a coding boot camp student that is going through the Prework modules. It contains some helpful information and brief notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Installation

For this prework, all you need to install are Visual Studio Code and some content from a ZIP file that is provided in one of the modules. There is also a Chrome Extension you need called ScreenCastify to record your screen and work for future purposes. I suggest going through the module and reading the steps to make these installations correctly, but it is fairly simple. I actually used VS Code to write this README!

## Usage

When using this study guide, you will see different sections to go through. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser where a list of topics we learned from the prework is provided. I also suggest what to study first!
